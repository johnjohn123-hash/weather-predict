# Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a **weather prediction** system built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It uses the **Szeged Weather Dataset (2006â€“2016)** from Kaggle to train various regression models to predict weather-related features such as temperature.

##  Dataset

**Weather in Szeged 2006-2016**  
This dataset contains hourly/daily weather data from Szeged, Hungary, including:
- Temperature
- Pressure
- Wind Speed
- Humidity  
And more.
